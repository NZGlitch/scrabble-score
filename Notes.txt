Enter members

Create Draw - round 1 is by grade, if odd # then last one matched to grade below

If an odd number of players:
	A random person from the top grade will be selected to have 2 games with 2 random players from the top available grade below thier grade

They play, and put their 'tokens' on the pinboard appropriate.

END of round:
	Its possible that slow players may not finish in time for the next draw!!!!

Subsequent Draws
	Pair of in order of high score, so long as players have not played eachother before
	ODD:
		Lowest scoring player from the highest grade that has not been 'odd one out before'
		Select the two players from the previous round with the highest score below the players score and of a grade lower than that player and that the tripple palyer has not played yet.

		If ruleset can not be satisfied, director to make a determination.

NOTE: # of players can change throughout the night, affecting the odd-one-out rules
Director should be able to edit draws



Problem Statement:
	* VERIFICATION
		1 player submits - other initials
		Game Score: 180 - 700 - prompt to confirm
		Bingo's: 0 - 6
		TT: 0-3
		100+: 0-3

		When entering score, director can change an opponents name, however they will need to be warned:
			* Previous entered score for that opponent will be deleted
			* Auto fill when entering that opponents original draw wont work
			


	* Important that mouseless entry is fast and nice
	* Table Money
	* Affiliated Member
	* Number of rounds - 2 people play each other
	* A person can play more than one game a round
	* Each person keeps a personal score - 
			The person who has won takes a token with their name, and a token with thier opponents name, and places them both on the scoreboard.

	Write down:
	* Opp Name, thier score, opponents score, thier bingo, thier # of tripple-tripples, # thier turns scored 100+, List of actual 100+ words, Opps grade, Thier name, the date

	* Round score is:
		Base = Pscore/100 + Bingos + TT + 100turns
		Win = GradeBonus
		Draw = GradeBonus/2
		Loss = 0
		Total for round is base + win/draw/loss + (pscore >= 500 ? 1 : 0)

	* Total for night is (sum of scores / # games) * 3

	* Matrix for calculating grade bonus (requires both players grades to work out)

	Create a CSV with a row for each player at the end of the night with the following columns:
		* List of 100+ words
		* Player Name
		* Player Grade
		* Total 'Night' Score this week
		* Average Game score this week
		* # Bingos this week
		* # TTs this week
		* # 100+ this week
		* Best individual game score this year
		* Date of best score
		* Average game score this year


MVP Perspective:

* Ability to enter membership
	Name, Grade

* Ability to create an event
* Ability to specify who is playing

Each Round:
	Adjust players present (add/remove - if adding and need swiss, use avg score for grade in previous round)
	Create a draw following rules above - IFF not all scores for previous rounds are available ask director to provide a estimate
	Allow director to modify draw
	Play begins
	Players write their round result on a small slip, and then hand these to the director
	Round can only be closed out when all scores are complete, BUT new rounds can be created.

At the end of the night
- Director selects 'score night'
- System advises of any unclosed rounds
- generates csv file for upload

Overall: Ability to export ALL data with a given date range

Fun: Upload board
